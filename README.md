# Youdownload

Hey, Welcome to Youdownload, a home-made youtube video downloader.

- Youdownload_cmd: a py file located in sources, its the first version of youdownload that i made, its using console command and require Python and Pytube
- Youdownload.py:  a py file located in sources with the GUI but requiring python, Pytube and tkinter
- Youdownload.exe: a executable file (.exe) usable on windows not requiring python nor tkinter or Pytube

FUNCTIONNALITIES
